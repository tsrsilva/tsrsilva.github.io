I am an entomologist, programmer, and writer. Currently based at the Universidade Federal do Paran√°, Curitiba, Brazil as a Postdoctoral Fellow within the [Feitosa Lab][feitosa-lab], developing digitization frameworks that allow curators to realistic manage local biological collections.

As an entomologist, my interests reside in comparative anatomy of ants and wasps, taxonomy, and specialized terminology.

As a programmer, I am interested in relational and semantic data models, database theory, data provenance, and first-order logic.

As a writer, my inspirations lie in speculative fiction, especially Octavia E. Butler, Ursula K Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, and Samuel R. Delany.
