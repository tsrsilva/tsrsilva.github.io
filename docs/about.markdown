I am an entomologist, programmer, and writer. Currently an independent researcher based in Aracaju, Brazil, working with semantic modelling, critical archival studies, etymology and translation, and videogame studies.

As an entomologist, my interests reside in comparative anatomy of ants and wasps, theories in biological systematics, and specialized terminology and nomenclature.

As a programmer, I am interested in relational and semantic data models, database theory, data provenance, and first-order logic.

As a writer, my inspirations lie in speculative fiction, especially Octavia E. Butler, Ursula K Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, and Samuel R. Delany.
