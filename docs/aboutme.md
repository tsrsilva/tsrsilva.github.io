title: About me
---

I am a Brazilian entomologist, programmer, and writer. Currently a postdoctoral researcher based in Helsinki, Finland, working with semantic modelling, critical archival studies, etymology and translation, and videogame studies.

As a biologist, my interests reside in specialized terminology and nomenclature, archival science and natural history/biological collections' studies, and ethics of naming.

As a programmer, I am interested in relational and semantic data models, database theory, data provenance, and ethics of datafication.

As a writer, my inspirations lie in speculative and weird fiction, such as Octavia E. Butler, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, Jorge L. Borges, Samuel R. Delany, and Mariana Enriquez, among others.
