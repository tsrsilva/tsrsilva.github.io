title: About me
---

I am a Brazilian entomologist, programmer, and writer. Currently a postdoctoral researcher based in Helsinki, Finland, working with semantic modelling, critical archival studies, etymology and translation, and videogame studies. You can find my CV [here]({%/assets/pdfs/cv.pdf%}).

As an entomologist, my interests reside in comparative anatomy of ants, bees, and wasps, theories in biological systematics, and specialized terminology and nomenclature.

As a programmer, I am interested in relational and semantic data models, database theory, data provenance, and first-order logic.

As a writer, my inspirations lie in speculative fiction, especially Octavia E. Butler, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, and Samuel R. Delany.
