I am Thiago Silva. I am a biologist, programmer, and writer. I worked as a researcher at UFPR and HKU. I am an alumnus of FURB, USP, and UFPR. Currently an independent researcher.

In the "About me" tab you will know more about my background and interests.

In the "Translation" tab, you will find open-source translations made by me. Currently, the only target language (TL) is Portuguese, but I am planning on working with other languages as well.
